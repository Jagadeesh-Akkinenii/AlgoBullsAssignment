# AlgoBullsAssignment

--------INSTRUCTIONS--------

In this repository you will be able to see 9 files
excluding this file.

The main files are as follows
1. with_alphavantage_api_key.ipynb
2. with_postman_collection_AAPL.ipynb
3. with_postman_collection_GOOGL.ipynb

As the names of these Jupyter Notebook files suggest
the first one should be considered if you have your own
API key for Alpha Vantage, the second and third files 
work based on the JSON, CSV files in the repository which
were exported from Postman.

I will be stopping this here for now, I will be adding more
details and update the instruction. I will also be adding
comments to the codes by 10:00 PM of 16th February,2023 as I did
not expect it to take this long to code.

Feel free to test out these code.

Note:
I don't know why but with_alphavantage_api_key.ipynb often 
randomly gets error and running it a few times manually gives the
proper output I am assuming its because of some issue while fetching
data from Alpha Vantage.
