# --------INSTRUCTIONS--------

In this repository you will be able to see 9 files
excluding this file.

The main files are as follows
1. with_alphavan_api.ipynb
2. AAPL_postman_collection.ipynb
3. GOOGL_postman_collection.ipynb

As the names of these Jupyter Notebook files suggest,
## 1. AAPL_postman_collection.ipynb
The first one is used when we want use Alpha Vantage package
which directly fetches the desired data from Alpha Vantage
(API KEY MAYBE REQUIRED). We just have to change the parameters
while calling the class, functions, methods to "GOOGL" or "AAPL".

## 2. AAPL_postman_collection.ipynb
The second and third files work based on the JSON, CSV files in
the repository which were exported from postman.com. This program
works on AAPL stock data.

## 3. GOOGL_postman_collection.ipynb
This one is completely similar to 2nd file except this one works on 
GOOGL stock data.

## for_ide.py
You can use for_ide.py in IDLE/IDE this gives the same result except
this programs asks at the starting of the program if you want GOOGL data
or AAPL data.

For all the programs I added comments which should explain most of the details.

Feel free to test out these codes.

Note:
I don't know why but with_alphavan_api.ipynb often randomly gets 
errors regarding API calls and running it a few times gives the
proper output I am assuming its because of some issue while fetching
data from Alpha Vantage.
